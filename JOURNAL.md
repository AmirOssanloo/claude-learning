Track daily progress, decisions, and learnings about Claude AI agent workflows.

## 2025-01-24

### Claude Configuration Improvements
- Created plan management infrastructure (`.claude/plans/` and `_history/`)
- Added standardized plan template for consistent task tracking
- Consolidated duplicate documentation to reduce confusion
- Standardized tech stack specifications across all files
- Established clear separation between user-facing (root CLAUDE.md) and detailed (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`) documentation

### Key Decisions
- **Plan Status Workflow**: Using emoji indicators (🟡 ⏸️ 🛠 🔍 ✅) for clear visual status
- **Documentation Structure**: Root files for overview, `.claude/` for detailed implementation
- **Agent Handoffs**: Each agent must verify previous agent's work before proceeding

### Completed Improvements
- ✅ Created base agent template (AGENT_BASE.md) to eliminate redundancy
- ✅ Refactored all agent files to reference base and focus on unique responsibilities
- ✅ Added workflow validation guide with specific checks for each agent
- ✅ Updated documentation structure to be clearer and more maintainable
- ✅ Fixed project name inconsistency (now "Claude Learning Sample" everywhere)
- ✅ Removed duplicate pnpm warnings (consolidated to single mentions)

### Impact
- Reduced agent file sizes by ~40% by extracting common rules
- Clear workflow validation steps prevent common mistakes
- Consistent project naming and tech stack across all docs
- Plan management system ready for use with proper templates
