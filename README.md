### Core Applications

- **Game Editor**: React-based visual editor with drag-and-drop interface
- **API Server**: Fastify backend handling user management, game storage, and assets
- **Game Runtime**: Lightweight player for published games with optimized loading

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - JavaScript runtime
- **pnpm 8+** - Package manager (required)
- **Docker** - For local development environment
- **AWS CLI** - For deployment and asset management
- **PostgreSQL** - Database (or use AWS RDS for production)
- **Redis** - Caching and real-time features

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start all development servers
pnpm dev

# Available development commands
pnpm dev:editor     # Game editor only (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm dev:api        # API server only (http://localhost:8000)
pnpm dev:runtime    # Game runtime only (http://localhost:3001)

# Database setup
pnpm db:setup       # Initialize local database
pnpm db:migrate     # Run database migrations
pnpm db:seed        # Seed with sample data

# Testing
pnpm test           # Run all tests
pnpm test:e2e       # End-to-end game creation tests
pnpm test:engine    # Game engine performance tests

# Build for production
pnpm build          # Build all applications
pnpm build:editor   # Build game editor only
pnpm build:runtime  # Build game runtime only
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/arcadeforge"
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
AWS_S3_BUCKET="arcadeforge-assets"
AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN="cdn.arcadeforge.com"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="your-google-oauth-id"

# Development
NODE_ENV="development"
LOG_LEVEL="debug"
```

3. **Implement**: Follow hexagonal architecture patterns
4. **Review**: Automated code review with quality checks
5. **Test**: Comprehensive testing including game engine performance
6. **Deploy**: Automated deployment to AWS infrastructure

### Game Engine Development
- Focus on performance optimization for 60fps gameplay
- Implement comprehensive physics testing for game mechanics
- Maintain backward compatibility for published games
- Use feature flags for experimental game features
